# PromptedGraphs

PromptedGraphs is a Python library designed to leverage large language models for advanced data processing tasks, including schema generation, data validation, modeling, normalization, extraction, entity resolution, and entity linking. It aims to transform unstructured text into structured data, resolve entity relationships, and seamlessly integrate extracted data with existing databases.

## Features

- **Generation**: Generate schemas and data samples from Pydantic DataModels.
- **Validation**: Validate schemas and data against specifications or models.
- **Modeling**: Create conceptual, logical, and physical data models.
- **Normalization**: Convert data to fit schema specifications with light reformats.
- **Extraction**: Extract structured data from unstructured text.
- **Entity Resolution**: Deduplicate entities, resolve coreferences, and canonicalize fields.
- **Entity Linking**: Link entities to database records and efficiently update databases.

## Installation

Install PromptedGraphs using pip:

```bash
pip install promptedgraphs
```

## Usage

Here's a quick example to get you started:

```python
from promptedgraphs.extraction import text_to_data
from myproject.models import MyDataModel

# Example text
text = "Your example text goes here."

# Extract data from text
data = text_to_data(text, model=MyDataModel)

print(data)
```

Replace `MyDataModel` with your Pydantic `DataModel` tailored to your specific needs.
