# PromptedGraphs

**From Dataset Labeling to Deployment: The Power of NLP and LLMs Combined.**

## Description

PromptedGraphs is a Python library that aims to seamlessly integrate traditional NLP methods with the capabilities of modern Large Language Models (LLMs) in the realm of knowledge graphs. Our library offers tools tailored for dataset labeling, model training, and smooth deployment to production environments. We leverage the strengths of [spacy](https://github.com/explosion/spaCy) for core NLP tasks, [snorkel](https://github.com/closedloop-technologies/snorkel) for effective data labeling, and `async` to ensure enhanced performance. Our mission is to provide a harmonized solution to knowledge graph development when you have to merge traditional and LLM-driven approaches, squarely addressing the challenges associated with accuracy, efficiency, and affordability.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Customize ER labels based on your domain.
- **Entity Resolution**: Deduplication and normalization
- **Relationship Extraction**: Either open ended labels or constrain to your domain
- **Entity Linking**: Link references in text to entities in a graph
- **Graph Construction**: Create or update knowledge graphs
  
## Core Functions

- **Dataset Labeling**: Efficient tools for labeling datasets, powered by `haystack`.
- **Model Training**: Combine the reliability of NLP and the prowess of LLMs.
- **Deployment**: Streamlined processes to ensure smooth transition to production.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or newer.
